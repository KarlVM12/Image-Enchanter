# Image Enchanter
An image manipulation app created as part of an android mobile challenge. This app asynchronously downloads a set of images from the web where the user can then 
choose to edit however they want. There are various different filters options, text overlays, and other color changes you can make to an image. You can then save
and upload the image back to the web.

# How to Use
Simply download the apk onto your android device, and Image Enchanter will start doing its magic!
